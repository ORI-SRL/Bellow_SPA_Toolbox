# Bellow_SPA_Toolbox

BellowSPA Toolbox is an interface that helps the design process of bending bellow soft pneumatic actuators. This software simulates and analyzes the design of the motion and force performance of the bending bellow soft pneumatic actuators via theoretical modeling and finite element analysis simulation. 

## Technologies
Matlab R2020a (with Symbolic Math Toolbox) + Comsol Multiphysics 5.6 (with Nonlinear Structural Materials Module)

## Setup
To run this toolbox, first launch the COMSOL Multiphysics 5.6 with MATLAB . Then add the download ''BellowSPA" file to the matlab path. Open the ''Toolbox" App with Matlab.
