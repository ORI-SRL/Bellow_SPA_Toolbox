# Bellow_SPA_Toolbox

BellowSPA Toolbox is an interface that helps the design process of bending bellow soft pneumatic actuators. This software simulates and analyzes the design of the motion and force performance of the bending bellow soft pneumatic actuators via theoretical modeling and finite element analysis simulation. 

## Technologies
Matlab R2020a (with Symbolic Math Toolbox) + Comsol Multiphysics 5.6 (with Nonlinear Structural Materials Module)

## Setup
To run this toolbox, first launch the COMSOL Multiphysics 5.6 with MATLAB . Then add the download ''BellowSPA" file to the matlab path. Open the ''Toolbox" App with Matlab.


# Supplementary Video

The included MP4 video demonstrates the usability of the proposed open-source SPA design toolbox
1. the framework of the toolbox.
2. the introduction of the toolbox graphical user interface.
3. a demonstration of the use of the toolbox for fast theoretical simulation in iterative design.
4. a demonstration of the use of the toolbox for detailed FEA modelling.
5. the toolbox is uploaded to GitHub and will be made public after the paper is accepted. Users need to have access to MATLAB and COMSOL Multiphysics.
